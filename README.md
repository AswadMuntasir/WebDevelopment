Web Development Projects
========================

**Guess The Color Game**  
	This game is my first hands-on project in javascript in the world of web dev.  

**JavaScript Interactive Photo Gallery**  
	A simple photo gallery application built with javascript that displays selected images in a bigger frame with overlapping alt text.

**JavaScript Autocomplete with JavaScript**  
	This simple project finally made me realize the magic behind automatic input field completion and validation that is so ubiquitous in web forms.

**Dynamic Photo Gallery**  
	A photo gallery application that displays pictures relevant to the term that the user searches for. The application populates the webpage with pictures gathered from pixabay that provides free images. This project uses a mix of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery and its AJAX features.
