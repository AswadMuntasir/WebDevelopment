Web Development Projects
========================

**Guess The Color Game**  
	This game is my first hands-on project in javascript in the world of web dev  

**JavaScript Interactive Photo Gallery**  
	A simple photo gallery application built with javascript that displays selected images in a bigger frame with overlapping alt text  

**JavaScript Autocomplete with JavaScript**  
	This simple project finally made me realize the magic behind automatic input field completion and validation that is so ubiquitous in web forms
